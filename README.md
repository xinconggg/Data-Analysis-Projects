# Projects

## [Project 1: Exploring Global Temperature Trends - A Comparative Analysis with Singapore](https://github.com/xinconggg/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Project%201%20-%20%20Exploring%20Global%20Temperature%20Trends.ipynb)
In this project, I applied the ARIMA model for time-series analysis to explore short-term temperature trends globally and in Singapore. By leveraging Python and key data science libraries, I conducted data cleaning, created subsets, and visualized temperature patterns. The ARIMA model was employed to predict future temperature trends (2024-2034). The results revealed nuanced global fluctuations and a consistent upward trajectory in Singapore's climate. This holistic approach provides valuable insights for climate analysis and policy planning, showcased through informative plots displaying predicted temperature trends for both global and Singaporean climates.

## [Project 2: E-commerce Sales Insights: Unveiling Trends and Enhancing Decision-Making](https://github.com/xinconggg/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Project%202%20-%20E-commerce%20Sales%20Insights.md)
In this project, I employed a comprehensive approach to analyze an e-commerce sales dataset, focusing on diverse dimensions such as sales channels, product categories, customer segments, and regional variations. Utilizing advanced analytical techniques and tools, including Python and Tableau, I conducted extensive data exploration, cleaning, and segmentation. The project delved into product category contributions, customer segmentation, promotion impact assessment and forecasting for future planning. The interactive visualizations created using Tableau offer stakeholders a clear and accessible representation of complex insights. This strategic analysis equips decision-makers with actionable insights, facilitating targeted interventions and informed decision-making for sustained growth in the dynamic e-commerce landscape.

## [Project 3: Revolutionizing Bank Lending Through Loan Analytics](https://github.com/xinconggg/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Project%203%20-%20Revolutionizing%20Bank%20Lending%20Through%20Loan%20Analytics.md)
This project aimed to revolutionize bank lending through advanced loan analytics, employing tools such as Excel, SQL, and Power BI. Key objectives included developing a risk management framework, enhancing operational efficiency, benchmarking loan performance, and ensuring regulatory compliance. The analysis focused on defining and visualizing key performance indicators, categorizing loans as good or bad, and creating interactive dashboards. Monthly trends, regional analysis, loan term insights, and more were explored. The project's impact was summarized in an overview, highlighting its transformative effect on data-driven decision-making, operational transparency, and strategic adaptability within the dynamic financial landscape.
