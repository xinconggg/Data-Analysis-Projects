## Project 1: Exploring Global Temperature Trends - A Comparative Analysis with Singapore
In this project, I applied the ARIMA model for time-series analysis to explore short-term temperature trends globally and in Singapore. By leveraging Python and key data science libraries, I conducted data cleaning, created subsets, and visualized temperature patterns. The ARIMA model was employed to predict future temperature trends (2024-2034). The results revealed nuanced global fluctuations and a consistent upward trajectory in Singapore's climate. This holistic approach provides valuable insights for climate analysis and policy planning, showcased through informative plots displaying predicted temperature trends for both global and Singaporean climates.
