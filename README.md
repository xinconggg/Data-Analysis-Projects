## [Employee Attrition Risk Analysis](https://github.com/xinconggg/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/(Project)%20Employee%20Attrition%20Risk%20Analysis/Employee%20Attrition%20Risk%20Analysis.ipynb)
This project aims to analyze employee attrition factors and develop a predictive model to identify at-risk employees, helping organizations improve retention strategies. The workflow includes:
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies, along with encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features for model stability.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying key factors influencing attrition through correlation analysis, distribution plots, and outlier detection to uncover valuable insights.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features like average monthly income per year and tenure ratios to enhance predictive power.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building and tuning machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with cross-validation for robust performance.
- **Model Evaluation and Validation:** Assessing models using precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and cross-validation scores to select the best-performing model.
- **Interactive App Deployment:** Developing a Streamlit app for real-time predictions, including bulk CSV file uploads and manual inputs for single employee risk assessments.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating interactive Power BI dashboards for real-time data exploration, pattern identification, and strategic decision-making.
Overall, the project integrates data science, machine learning, and interactive data visualization to provide a comprehensive solution for proactive employee retention management.
